But I decided to do it anyway because it was my very first project. So, there are some kinds of emotions involved in it. 

Apart from being my first project, it was my first time using GitHub as well.

All of this was using “https://www.theodinproject.com” as a guide and some YouTube tutorials for the GitHub part.


Hope first time of many more!

Thanks…
